**AI-Driven Wafer Yield Monitoring and Edge-Optimized Defect Inspection System
with LLM-Based Manufacturing Intelligence**
📖 Overview

This project presents an intelligent semiconductor manufacturing monitoring system that integrates:

📷 CNN-based wafer defect detection

📊 Machine learning-based yield prediction

⚡ Edge-optimized real-time inspection

🧠 LLM-powered manufacturing intelligence for root cause analysis

The goal is to enhance wafer yield, reduce defect rates, and provide interpretable AI-driven insights for semiconductor fabrication facilities (fabs).

🎯 Problem Statement

Semiconductor fabrication involves complex multi-stage processes where minor deviations can significantly affect wafer yield. Traditional defect inspection systems:

Are computationally heavy

Lack real-time intelligence

Do not provide explainable root-cause insights

This project proposes a hybrid AI architecture combining computer vision, predictive modeling, edge deployment, and large language models to address these limitations.
